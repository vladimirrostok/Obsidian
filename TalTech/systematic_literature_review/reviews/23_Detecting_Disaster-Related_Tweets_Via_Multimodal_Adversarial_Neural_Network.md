Abstract: "Recently, during natural disasters, the use of social media as a source of actionable information has increased significantly. Finding disaster-related tweets and analyzing their textual content and images can help government agencies and rescue organizations make better decisions. The main challenge of disaster-related message detection on social networking sites is how to identify posts related to emerging disaster events. Since most existing methods extract disaster-specific features that cannot be shared between different disaster events, they are difficult to deal with this challenge. In this article, we propose a novel multimodal adversarial neural network (MANN) to handle the above challenge. MANN consists of three modules: a feature extraction module, a tweet detection module, and a disaster discrimination module. The feature extraction module uses BERT and VGG-19 to learn textual and visual feature representations from posts. Based on multimodal features, the tweet detection module is responsible for identifying posts related to disasters. MANN exploits the disaster discrimination module and adversarial training to captures disaster-invariant features for unseen disaster events. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the proposed model outperforms baseline methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-measure."
