### Extras: 
Such approaches typically involve training a classifier on manually annotated tweets to learn the correla- tions of features identifying tweets related to the topic of interest. Extending such systems to a new event category thus typically requires significant effort since one must pro- duce a new training set and retrain the classifier
The main idea is to use term co-occurrences to derive additional related terms, including shortened words, slang words, or hashtags, that might be relevant. Second, the algorithm uses this expanded set of terms to identify events and associate them with struc- tured and meaningful summaries.
