Abstract: A main challenges in finding the desired event in the locality is that there is a lot of unstructured data. It required a lot of work to make sure all those huge data to align with the output that we desire. We can say that discovering what is happening around the user is also so important for other application also. It can also help in monitoring crimes, predicting the natural disasters, protests. Many people post status and whatâ€™s happening in the real time data in their social accounts, they act as a human sensor. With the increasing in population and decrease in recreational landmarks, many people undergo the path with adjustment in order to attend event they are interested in. While posting the status people not only post status but also their location along with it. In this project using that geo tag, we are extracting information about that event happening in that locality and one can get detailed information regarding the event. We are doing novel framework to find the events in current time from geo tagged twitter information and keep record of such event over time. It collects these data in huge amount from twitter and find meaningful candidates for the description of events. After collecting all those data by using clustering keyword it narrows down the data with the help of the geo tagged location similarity.
