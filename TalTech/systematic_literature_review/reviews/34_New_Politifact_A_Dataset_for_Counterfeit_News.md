Abstract: Fake news is a fictitious article that is intentionally written to deceive people. So it is difficult to detect fake news based on the content of the news article. Online platforms publish these fabricated stories to make more money by enhancing the number of readerships. There is a need to detect fake news as early as possible. The lack of a standard dataset makes this task more challenging. So, In this paper, we proposed a new dataset that is scraped from Politifact websites. This dataset is larger in size in comparison to the existing datasets. We conducted extensive experiments by training state of the art machine learning and deep-learning algorithm. The results depict the effectiveness of our proposed dataset.
