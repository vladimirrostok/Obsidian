Abstract: As communication technology advances, various andheterogeneous data are communicated in distributed environments through network systems. Meanwhile, along with thedevelopment of communication technology, the attack surfacehas expanded, and concerns regarding network security haveincreased. Accordingly, to deal with potential threats, researchon network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) has been activelyconducted. Among the various NIDS technologies, recent interestis focused on artificial intelligence (AI)-based anomaly detectionsystems, and various models have been proposed to improve theperformance of NIDS. However, there still exists the problemof data imbalance, in which AI models cannot sufficiently learnmalicious behavior and thus fail to detect network threats accurately. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based NIDS that canefficiently resolve the data imbalance problem and improve theperformance of the previous systems. To address the aforementioned problem, we leveraged a state-of-the-art generative modelthat could generate plausible synthetic data for minor attacktraffic. In particular, we focused on the reconstruction error andWasserstein distance-based generative adversarial networks, andautoencoder-driven deep learning models. To demonstrate theeffectiveness of our system, we performed comprehensive evaluations over various data sets and demonstrated that the proposedsystems significantly outperformed the previous AI-based NIDS.
