Abstract: Design proposal for an AI-driven military situational awareness application. Current events in Ukraine have emphasized the importance of the Information Environment in supporting military operations. Activities in the physical domain are processed in the virtual domain of computers and networks before being interpreted by the human cognitive domain where decisions are made. Commanders at all levels have an ever increasing amount of information of varying latency and reliability available to them from a variety of sources. These range from highly sophisticated and complex bespoke surveillance systems to individuals equipped with a smartphone and Internet connection. An effective commander must be able to assimilate all the information sources available to them and be able to visualise the battlespace in an accurate and timely manner. To assist them, there are already a wide variety of software applications capable of receiving multiple inputs and displaying the disposition of military forces within a mapping environment. However, these tools place the interpretation and analysis responsibilities with the human operator. This paper proposes an AI driven process in which the initial analysis and correlation function is conducted in real time and in response to data inputs from multiple sources. This presents the decision maker with a fused, correlated and predictive Common Operational Picture providing a clear information advantage.
